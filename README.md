# daily routine tracker

```bash
'dailyrouter is a habit tracker application built with html,css,js,nodejs,mongodb,redis and converted into mobile app ,
where user will get new habit template each day (server logic) and he will complete the routine and check the task
it will be persistent with mongodb , if he fails to complete the task within scheduled time a "mail" will be sent by server automatically , stating
to complete the task. Used redis caching mechanism to get the stat of task completion avoiding the overhead on the main dtabase.

ps: since i used redis as server for hosting , it might require some time to turn up the page, but it will!
